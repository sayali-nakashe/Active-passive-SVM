Active and Passive Learning using SVM

In this project , I have studied various methods for classification of data on the Bank Note Authentication Data Set. This is a binary classification problem. <br>

The methods are listed below: <br>
1) Active Learning using Support Vector Machines <br>
--Used an L-1 penalized SVM for classification <br>
2) Passive Learning using Support Vector Machines <br>
--Used an L-1 penalized SVM for classification <br>

<b>Banknote authentication Data Set </b> <br>
Data were extracted from images that were taken for 
the evaluation of an authentication procedure for banknotes.

The data is downloaded from : 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication

Attribute Information: <br>
1. variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)  <br>
2. skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)  <br>
3. curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)  <br>
4. entropy of image (continuous)  <br>
5. class (integer)  <br>
